## Why Codux?

In the age of AI-assisted development, your IDE is no longer the center of your workflow — **the terminal is**.

Tools like Claude Code, GitHub Copilot CLI, Cursor, and Aider are turning the terminal into your primary development environment. But traditional terminals weren't designed for this:

- **Tab and split management is painful** — juggling multiple sessions across projects is slow and clunky
- **No project awareness** — no way to organize, switch, or get notifications per project
- **Git needs a separate app** — you're constantly switching between terminal, GitKraken, or Tower
- **AI usage is a black box** — you have no idea how many tokens you've burned today or which model is draining your quota
- **Electron-based alternatives are resource hogs** — they eat RAM and battery for what should be a lightweight tool

**Codux fixes all of this.** A native macOS terminal workspace purpose-built for AI CLI tools — multi-project, multi-pane, with built-in Git and real-time AI usage tracking. No Electron. No WebKit. Just pure SwiftUI + AppKit, fast and light.

## Features

| Screenshot | Feature | Description |
|:--|:--|:--|
| ![Codux Split Workspace](docs/images/screenshot.png) | Multi-Project Workspace | Organize all your projects in one place. Each project keeps its own terminal sessions, split layout, and state, with activity monitoring that helps you switch context without missing task completion. |
| ![Codux Git Panel](docs/images/git.png) | Built-in Git Panel | Manage branches, staged changes, file diffs, commit history, and remote sync directly in the sidebar instead of jumping to a separate Git app. |
| ![Codux AI Stats](docs/images/ai-stats.png) | AI Usage Dashboard | Track token usage, model usage, tool breakdowns, daily trends, and live sessions for AI coding tools running inside your terminal. |
| ![Codux Daily Level](docs/images/level.png) | Daily Level Ladder | See your current daily AI usage rank at a glance with the live ladder: `Idle`, `Light`, `Active`, `Focus`, `Intense`, `Grind`, `Limit`, `Godlike`. |
| ![Codux Pet System](docs/images/pet.png) | Coding Pet Companion | Claim an egg, grow a companion, unlock evolutions, fill the dex, and get contextual bubble reactions while you work. |

### Beautiful & Intuitive

Crafted with attention to every pixel. Glass vibrancy backgrounds, smooth animations, carefully balanced typography, and a clean visual hierarchy that stays out of your way. Light and dark mode are fully polished — not an afterthought. Customizable terminal themes, app icons, and keyboard shortcuts let you make it yours.

### Native & Lightweight

100% SwiftUI + AppKit. No Electron, no WebKit, no hidden browser eating your RAM. Launches instantly, idles at near-zero CPU, and respects your battery. This is what a macOS app should feel like.

## Getting Started

### Install with Homebrew

```bash
brew install --cask duxweb/tap/codux
```

### Update with Homebrew

```bash
brew update
brew upgrade --cask codux
```

### Install from Release

1. Download the latest release from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/duxweb/codux/releases) or [codux.dux.cn](https://codux.dux.cn)
2. Drag Codux to your Applications folder
3. Open Codux, click **New Project**, and pick a directory
4. Start typing — you're ready to go

> **"Cannot be opened because the developer cannot be verified"**
>
> Since Codux is not yet notarized by Apple, macOS may block the first launch. To fix this:
>
> ```bash
> sudo xattr -rd com.apple.quarantine /Applications/Codux.app
> ```
>
> Or go to **System Settings > Privacy & Security**, scroll down and click **Open Anyway** next to the Codux warning.

## Keyboard Shortcuts

| Action | Shortcut |
|:--|:--|
| New Split | `⌘T` |
| New Tab | `⌘D` |
| Toggle Git Panel | `⌘G` |
| Toggle AI Panel | `⌘Y` |
| Switch Project | `⌘1` - `⌘9` |

All shortcuts can be customized in **Settings > Shortcuts**.

## Pet System

### What It Is

The pet system is a lightweight companion layer built into Codux. It turns your everyday AI coding activity into a long-term progression loop: hatch an egg, grow a companion, unlock evolutions, fill the dex, and eventually inherit your fully grown pet into history.

### Current Pet Lineup

| Species | Base Stages | Route A | Route B |
|:--|:--|:--|:--|
| `VoidCat` | `Huahua` → `Shadow Cat` → `Voidcat` | `Tomecat` → `Inkspirit` | `Shadecat` → `Nightspirit` |
| `RustHound` | `Furball` → `Flop-Eared Pup` → `Rusthound` | `Blazehound` → `Sunflare` | `Ironwolf` → `Bloodmoon` |
| `Goose` | `Chirpy` → `Dozy` → `Goosey` | `Dawnwing` → `Wildfire` | `Windwing` → `Tempest` |

### How To Claim A Pet

- Open Codux and look at the title bar pet button.
- If you have not claimed a pet yet, click the pet button to open the egg claim dialog.
- Choose one egg, optionally enter a custom name, then confirm the claim.
- After claiming, the pet starts growing with your AI coding activity.

### Where To Find It

- `Title bar`: open the current pet popover, view hatching / level / traits, and access the dex
- `Pet Dex`: view unlocked stages, current pet details, and inheritance history
- `Settings > Pet`: configure pet enable state, static sprite mode, hydration reminders, sedentary reminders, and late-night reminders

### Menus And UI Entry Points

- The pet is not a separate app window by default; the main entry is the title bar pet button.
- Clicking the title bar pet button opens:
  - egg selection if no pet has been claimed
  - the pet popover if a pet is active
- The dex is opened from the pet popover.

### Hidden Pet Unlock

- One egg option is a random egg.
- The random egg has a chance to hatch a hidden species.
- The base chance is `15%`.
- If you have actively used `2` or more AI tools in the last `7` days, the chance increases directly to `50%`.

### Personality Dimensions

- `Wisdom`: longer, deeper requests and sustained high-context work
- `Chaos`: fast, frequent, short-cycle interaction
- `Night`: late-night usage patterns
- `Stamina`: long-running sessions and sustained active time
- `Empathy`: iterative back-and-forth debugging and repair-style work

### Reminders

In **Settings > Pet**, you can configure:

- hydration reminder interval
- sedentary reminder interval
- late-night reminder interval
- pet enable / disable
- static pet sprite mode

## System Requirements

- macOS 14.0 (Sonoma) or later

## Feedback

Found a bug or have a feature request? Open an [issue on GitHub](https://github.com/duxweb/codux/issues).

When reporting a bug, please include the following diagnostics whenever possible:

### App Logs

The easiest way is:

- Open `Help -> Export Diagnostics…`
- Save the generated `.zip`
- Attach that archive to your GitHub issue

The diagnostics archive includes the most important files for troubleshooting, including:

- app runtime logs
- previous rotated logs
- performance event summary from the current app session
- saved app state files
- invalid state backups when available
- related crash / hang / spin reports from macOS when available

If you need to collect logs manually, Codux writes runtime logs to:

- `~/Library/Application Support/dmux/logs/dmux-debug.log`
- `~/Library/Application Support/dmux/logs/dmux-debug.previous.log`
- `~/Library/Application Support/dmux/logs/performance-summary.json`

Notes:

- Codux clears the previous app session logs on each launch, then starts a fresh runtime log for the current session
- `dmux-debug.previous.log` only appears if the current session log grows large enough to rotate
- `performance-summary.json` contains recent performance spike / main-thread stall summaries for the current session

You can also open the current log file from the app via the top bar action: `Debug Log`.

Or run this command in Terminal to open the log folder directly:

```bash
open ~/Library/Application\ Support/dmux/logs
```

### Crash Reports

If the app is frozen or unresponsive, still export diagnostics first from:

- `Help -> Export Diagnostics…`

If the app crashes or becomes unresponsive right after launch, macOS may generate a crash report here:

- `~/Library/Logs/DiagnosticReports/`

In most cases, the file you need will be named like one of these:

- `dmux-YYYY-MM-DD-*.ips`
- `dmux-bin-YYYY-MM-DD-*.ips`

If there are multiple files, please attach the one whose timestamp is closest to the time of the crash.

To open the crash report folder directly, run:

```bash
open ~/Library/Logs/DiagnosticReports
```

### Recommended Issue Attachments

Please attach or paste:

1. Your macOS version and Codux version
2. Steps to reproduce the issue
3. `dmux-debug.log`
4. `dmux-debug.previous.log` if it exists
5. `performance-summary.json` if it exists
6. The matching crash report from `~/Library/Logs/DiagnosticReports/` if the app crashed

If convenient, compress the relevant files into a single `.zip` before submitting the issue.

  Wanted to be dmux, but that name was taken. So it's Codux now, which sounds like "Cool Dux" in Chinese.
