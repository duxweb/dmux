# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [Unreleased]

## [0.5.11] - 2026-04-24

### Changed

- Simplified project activity tracking to rely on live runtime sessions plus UI completion presentation, removing stale cached status fallbacks from sidebar loading and completion handling.
- Removed legacy dmux state auto-merge compatibility and old memory extraction response schema compatibility that are no longer used by current Codux releases.

### Fixed

- Hardened pet progression around project add, remove, and reopen flows so stale project baselines are pruned automatically and historical tokens cannot be replayed into hatch or XP progress.
- Tightened runtime hook and polling coordination by ignoring tool-use/internal Codex memory sessions more precisely and matching managed hook cleanup by tool, reducing stale activity updates and duplicate hook state.
- Fixed memory extraction queue recovery for missing projects so abandoned extraction tasks are dropped cleanly instead of surfacing a persistent failure state.

## [0.5.10] - 2026-04-24

### Added

- Added per-provider test buttons in AI settings so configured memory extraction models and API credentials can be verified directly.
- Added per-tool runtime configuration groups for full-access mode, terminal launch default models, and global prompt injection across supported tools.

### Fixed

- Restored legacy dmux project/workspace configuration by merging old project state into the new Codux app support storage without overwriting current settings.
- Fixed terminal launch model overrides so Codex receives `--model=...`, Claude/Gemini/OpenCode receive `--model ...`, and blank model fields leave each CLI default untouched.

## [0.5.9] - 2026-04-24

### Changed

- Left built-in CLI memory extraction models blank by default for new settings, so Claude, Codex, Gemini, and OpenCode use their own CLI-configured default models unless the user explicitly enters one.

## [0.5.8] - 2026-04-24

### Fixed

- Rebuilt floating tooltips on a borderless AppKit panel anchored to each hovered control, keeping release-build hover labels positioned correctly without SwiftUI overlay clipping or system popover chrome.

## [0.5.7] - 2026-04-24

### Fixed

- Fixed release-build floating tooltips being stretched by their SwiftUI overlay container, keeping hover labels compact and anchored to the hovered control.

## [0.5.6] - 2026-04-24

### Fixed

- Fixed project loading stability so active AI responses stay visible until an explicit completion, interruption, or runtime idle event instead of expiring from a timer.
- Fixed Codex stale Stop hook handling so completion from an older interrupted turn cannot clear the loading state of a newer prompt.

## [0.5.5] - 2026-04-24

### Fixed

- Fixed Codex memory extraction model overrides by passing the configured model with the current Codex CLI `--model=...` form and updating the built-in Codex default to `gpt-5.3-codex`.

## [0.5.4] - 2026-04-24

### Fixed

- Replaced global floating tooltip windows with local SwiftUI overlays so sidebar and title-bar hover labels stay anchored to their controls in release builds.
- Fixed Codex memory extraction so Codux no longer forces the built-in default model over the user's local Codex provider configuration.

## [0.5.3] - 2026-04-24

### Fixed

- Fixed release-build AI memory extraction by resolving CLI paths from the user's login shell environment, so background Codex, Claude, Gemini, and OpenCode workers can find user-installed binaries even when Codux is launched from Finder.
- Fixed title-bar floating tooltips in release builds by resolving the anchor from the control's real AppKit frame, keeping hover labels attached to the correct button after packaging.

## [0.5.2] - 2026-04-24

### Changed

- Removed the debug DMG from the formal GitHub Release asset workflow; debug packages remain available through the manual test-build workflow.

### Fixed

- Fixed release-build floating tooltips by anchoring them to the real control overlay and presenting them with stable screen coordinates.
- Fixed AI memory extraction workers so Claude, Codex, Gemini, and OpenCode provider runs skip Codux terminal wrappers and resolve the real user-installed CLI instead.

## [0.5.1] - 2026-04-24

### Added

- Added an Automatic memory extraction provider mode that uses the current terminal tool first, then falls back to provider priority.

### Fixed

- Fixed release-build floating tooltips so title-bar hover labels stay anchored to their buttons instead of rendering lower in the window.
- Fixed AI memory extraction in release builds by giving background provider workers the same CLI search paths used by managed terminals.
- Fixed memory extraction failures so the title-bar memory indicator stays red and shows the latest concrete failure reason instead of falling back to idle.
- Fixed a crash when Codex exits before reading memory-extraction stdin by converting the broken pipe into a recoverable extraction failure.
- Fixed Codex interrupted-turn activity handling so a stale stop hook no longer clears the left-sidebar loading indicator while a follow-up response is already running.
- Clarified missing CLI errors so memory extraction reports that the Claude/Codex/Gemini/OpenCode CLI is missing from the application PATH instead of surfacing raw `/usr/bin/env` output.

## [0.5.0] - 2026-04-24

### Added

- Added the first AI memory system with SQLite-backed user memory, project memory, extraction queueing, compact merged project summaries, and limited working-memory injection for supported AI tools.
- Added AI settings for built-in and custom providers, including Claude, Codex, Gemini, OpenCode, and OpenAI-compatible extraction providers with model, base URL, API key, and memory-extraction controls.
- Added a lightweight memory status indicator in the title bar so extraction activity and queue state are visible without opening settings.
- Added terminal environment loading for project `.env` files when present, making configured AI CLI credentials and proxy variables available consistently inside Codux-managed terminals.

### Changed

- Renamed the settings Tools section to AI and moved runtime permissions, provider setup, and memory controls into one AI-focused settings surface.
- Kept appearance theme/background changes on the stable restart-required path instead of live-applying them to existing terminal surfaces.
- Updated README troubleshooting paths to the current Codux support directory and runtime log filenames.

### Fixed

- Fixed project terminal focus drift after long sessions by ignoring stale focused terminals from other projects and clearing hidden terminal responders when switching projects.
- Fixed closing the last visible terminal split so Codux now terminates the old session and starts a fresh project terminal instead of leaving the workspace blocked or refusing the action.
- Fixed long-running AI activity state renewal so hook-driven loading indicators stay tied to the active runtime session instead of expiring or reviving from stale state.
- Fixed Gemini/OpenCode/Codex runtime environment handling across managed terminals and memory extraction workers, including compatibility with custom API base URLs and credentials.

## [0.4.5] - 2026-04-24

### Changed

- Updated the bundled Ghostty package to the latest AppKit input-fix revision so Codux inherits the upstream terminal input handling fixes without carrying local compatibility shims.
- Reduced runtime log noise by suppressing repetitive activity-resolution, unchanged history-index, socket receive, and no-op hook ingress entries while keeping state transitions, failures, and actionable notification diagnostics visible.

### Fixed

- Fixed project AI activity state handling so left-sidebar loading and completed indicators now stay driven by real hook/runtime session state instead of being revived by tool-use hook noise, stale project activation recalculation, or unrelated realtime session probes.
- Fixed Codex and Claude hook ingestion so queued turns, interrupted turns, and runtime backfill edge cases resolve more consistently across prompt submission, completion, and follow-up turn start boundaries.
- Fixed managed hook installation cleanup so obsolete Codex and Claude tool-use hook registrations are stripped from app-managed config, preventing redundant hook traffic from older generated entries after runtime support refresh.

## [0.4.4] - 2026-04-23

### Fixed

- Fixed pet progression so newly indexed history from a project no longer grants retroactive pet XP the first time that project enters tracking; each project now establishes its own baseline before future growth is counted.
- Fixed project removal semantics for pet progression so removing or closing a project also clears that project's pet baseline, preventing large delayed XP jumps if the same project is re-added and re-indexed much later.

## [0.4.2] - 2026-04-23

### Changed

- Reworked app-owned runtime path resolution so logs, pet state, runtime support files, and tool-permission state now live under the active app's own Application Support directory, while transient runtime sockets and status files live under an owner-scoped temp root.
- Simplified debug/runtime log naming so release and development builds no longer rely on extra `.dev` or `.release` filename suffixes for separation; build identity now comes entirely from the app container path.

### Fixed

- Fixed multi-build hook coexistence for Codex, Claude, and Gemini by making injected dmux hook commands owner-aware, preserving other active app owners, and aggressively removing legacy ownerless hook entries from older helper paths.
- Fixed Codex config installation so `suppress_unstable_features_warning = true` is enforced as a real top-level TOML key instead of being written into nested notice tables, preventing startup warnings and invalid config structure after app bootstrap.
- Fixed runtime bootstrap path partitioning so `claude-session-map`, runtime socket files, and agent status state are now treated as temporary runtime artifacts instead of leaking into persistent support storage.
- Fixed pet storage migration for existing installs by auto-moving legacy `Application Support/dmux*/pet-state.dat` files into the new app-owned container and re-encrypting them under the current runtime namespace on first load.
- Fixed release cleanup metadata so the generated Homebrew cask zap path now matches the real Application Support directory used by current builds.

## [0.4.1] - 2026-04-23

### Fixed

- Fixed Codex runtime config installation so `suppress_unstable_features_warning` is now written as a top-level config key instead of corrupting `[notice.model_migrations]`, which previously caused Codex startup failures on updated user configs.
- Fixed live AI session presentation and aggregation edge cases so completed sessions remain visible in the realtime panel, current-session token cards stay bound to raw live totals, and overlay-only math no longer leaks into the per-session display path.
- Fixed runtime and historical AI accounting edge cases across completed-turn baselines, post-cutoff indexed session buckets, corrupted active-duration history rows, and stale managed-session cleanup so project totals, pet progression inputs, and live overlays stay aligned more reliably.
- Fixed runtime hook/bootstrap support for release builds by tightening socket/config handling and adding regression coverage around Codex config generation, runtime socket reconnectability, and live stats/session retention behavior.

## [0.4.0] - 2026-04-23

### Changed

- Replaced the terminal backend with the Ghostty stack and completed the follow-up workspace integration work so split panes, detached terminal windows, project switching, and restored terminal sessions now run on one consistent rendering path.
- Split several oversized app, terminal, AI stats, Git, settings, history-indexing, and pet modules into smaller focused units to keep the codebase easier to maintain and reduce future regression risk.
- Tuned AI history indexing profiles and Ghostty appearance handling, including curated bundled Ghostty themes and lower-overhead background indexing behavior.
- Refined pet progression, trait scoring, localized trait tooltips, and realtime refresh flow so pet state follows post-claim activity more consistently and remains easier to reason about.

### Fixed

- Fixed Ghostty terminal lifecycle issues across project switching, floating windows, restored terminals, bridge refreshes, and detached terminal handoff so terminal content, input, and scrolling stay stable during workspace transitions.
- Fixed live AI runtime accounting so tool switching, completed turns, indexed-history overlays, and realtime project totals no longer leak old session totals, double-count overlays, or drift between live and indexed views.
- Fixed historical AI session queries used by pet progression and statistics so post-cutoff session buckets are counted with the correct time boundary semantics instead of dropping ongoing sessions or mixing in the wrong totals.
- Fixed bundled Ghostty theme color parsing so selected built-in themes now resolve and apply correctly after relaunch.
- Fixed pet progression bookkeeping, stale session-watermark cleanup, and trait refresh edge cases so egg, XP, and trait state no longer drift or get inflated by orphaned realtime session state.

## [0.3.2] - 2026-04-20

### Fixed

- Fixed terminal paste and other standard Command-key editing shortcuts after the terminal key passthrough change by keeping Command-based shortcuts in AppKit instead of forwarding them as raw terminal key events.
- Fixed Git sidebar auto-refresh after terminal-driven Git operations so commits and other `.git` metadata updates now invalidate the changed-file list immediately instead of leaving stale entries behind until a manual refresh.

## [0.3.1] - 2026-04-20

### Changed

- Refined the AI stats panel so project switching now shows a lightweight summary first, defers heavier detail sections, and limits session history to the most recent 20 entries for smoother navigation.
- Adjusted the default pet reminder cadence to healthier starter values: sedentary reminders every 30 minutes, hydration reminders every 2 hours, and late-night reminders every 1 hour.

### Fixed

- Fixed queued-turn loading state handling for Codex and Claude so follow-up prompts in the same session stay in `loading` until the final queued response really settles, instead of clearing too early or getting stuck.
- Fixed terminal key passthrough so unreserved shortcuts such as `Shift+Tab` reach the underlying AI terminal correctly without being swallowed by the app shell.
- Fixed top/bottom terminal split persistence so resized tab-region height no longer resets when switching projects and returning.
- Fixed AI panel project switching stutter by synchronizing live runtime state immediately and postponing heavy detail rendering until after the lightweight panel state is visible.
- Removed the remaining pet debug controls and unused pet debug localization entries from the shipping app so release builds no longer expose internal testing affordances.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-04-19

### Added

- Added the desktop pet system to Codux, including egg claim flow, hatching, level and evolution progression, inheritance, per-stage dex, and dedicated sprite/effect resources.
- Added a dedicated `Settings > Pet` tab with pet enable/static mode controls plus configurable hydration, sedentary, and late-night reminder intervals.
- Added localized user-facing pet documentation to both READMEs and integrated feature screenshots for split workspace, Git, AI stats, daily level, and pet views.

### Changed

- Refined pet growth so trait values start at `0` when the egg is claimed, accumulate from post-claim AI activity, and refresh on an hourly cadence.
- Reworked pet personality scoring to remove tool-brand bias from wisdom, distribute long-term token growth across all attributes, and avoid collapsing into a single persona when scores stay close together.
- Reworked empathy scoring to favor real iterative repair behavior, including multi-turn debugging loops and sustained correction-heavy coding sessions, instead of only very short prompt bursts.
- Moved pet controls out of General settings into a dedicated Pet tab and tightened dex overlay interaction and copy for a more consistent user-facing experience.

### Fixed

- Fixed Claude completion handling so `Stop` now marks a finished turn directly from hook semantics, while `Idle` and `SessionEnd` still clear loading without losing the distinction between cleanup and completion.
- Fixed Codex loading stalls after non-definitive `Stop` hooks by treating settled idle probe state as a real completion signal and stopping deferred stop hooks from reasserting stale `responding` state.
- Fixed pet storage so release and development builds now use separate encrypted local `.dat` files without triggering Keychain access prompts.
- Fixed pet spotlight overlay dismissal so clicking anywhere on the dimmed background closes it reliably, with a stronger backdrop for better focus.
- Fixed late-night pet reminders to use the `23:00-06:00` window and made reminder timing follow the configured pet reminder intervals.

## [0.2.2] - 2026-04-18

### Changed

- Hardened wrapped Claude launches so Codux now resolves the real Claude binary more reliably and prefers system tool paths when starting managed Claude sessions.

### Fixed

- Reduced the risk of terminal process exhaustion by delaying hidden pane PTY startup and capping managed Claude process trees before they can exhaust the user's process budget.

## [0.2.1] - 2026-04-18

### Added

- Added terminal font-size controls in Settings > Appearance so terminal text size can be adjusted with direct numeric input.
- Added a dedicated Tools settings tab for configuring default permission mode for Codex, Claude Code, Gemini, and OpenCode launches inside Codux terminals.
- Added a Notifications settings tab with per-channel enable switches plus address/token fields for Bark, ntfy, WxPusher, Feishu, DingTalk, WeCom, Telegram, Discord, Slack, and generic webhooks.
- Added background external notification delivery for the configured notification channels so completion events can fan out without blocking the UI, with silent failure handling recorded in debug logs.
- Simplified the WxPusher notification channel to the SPT quick-send flow, removing the unused token field and aligning the setup UI with the one-parameter mode.

### Changed

- Hardened the Codex, Claude, Gemini, and OpenCode runtime drivers so loading, interrupt, resume, and per-turn live token display now follow tool-driven session events instead of unstable cross-session carryover.
- Tightened tool binary resolution inside Codux terminals so Claude now follows the exact executable path resolved by the user's current shell environment rather than guessing install locations.
- Refined the AI stats status bar so the refresh action is hidden while a stats refresh is actively running, keeping the update state focused on progress and stop controls.
- Updated the app menu's About and Updates actions to use icons and appear as one grouped app-info section.
- Refined the Notifications settings cards with channel-specific labels, localized setup copy, cleaner field alignment, and direct links to each provider's documentation.
- Hardened external notification delivery with unified request timeouts, disabled request caching, and richer debug logs for request start, latency, status codes, and sanitized response summaries.

### Fixed

- Fixed live AI usage tracking across Codex, Claude, Gemini, and OpenCode so both new sessions and restored historical sessions now start from `0` live tokens and only show per-turn token deltas after each completed response.
- Fixed tool-session rebinding across reopen, resume, interrupt, and multi-terminal paths so restored sessions no longer inherit totals, models, or loading state from the previous live session.
- Reduced live runtime log noise to keep only actionable tracing around hook/socket events, logical session lifecycle, response transitions, and token commits.
- Localized the new Tools settings copy across the app's supported languages and removed the duplicate tool-name label shown beside each permission picker.
- Fixed the Sparkle update prompt background so it no longer turns transparent after the window loses focus.
- Fixed split-pane terminal relayout so creating or resizing splits no longer compresses terminal content into broken multi-column text layouts.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-04-17

### Added

- Added Sparkle-based in-app updates backed by GitHub Releases, including automatic background checks on launch, an app-menu update action, signed `appcast.xml` generation in CI, and bundled release-update documentation.
- Added Homebrew tap publishing in the release workflow so tagged releases can update the maintained cask automatically.
- Added bilingual release-notes generation for GitHub Releases and Sparkle appcasts by combining `CHANGELOG.md` and `CHANGELOG.zh-CN.md` when both version entries exist.

### Changed

- Refined AI runtime session tracking around tool session state, terminal-to-session association, and live usage aggregation so Codex, Claude, Gemini, and OpenCode can rebuild live state more consistently across reopen, resume, and multi-terminal paths.
- Refined terminal split rendering and AI stats panel interaction behavior to reduce layout instability, improve hover handling, and keep panel interactions smoother under frequent updates.
- Documented the release/update flow, Homebrew install path, and changelog maintenance process so ongoing development notes stay under `Unreleased` until a version is cut.

### Fixed

- Fixed updater packaging so release builds embed the Sparkle public key, ship a signed `appcast.xml`, and can surface embedded release notes directly inside the update dialog.
- Fixed release-note publishing so the generated notes can fall back to English when a matching Chinese changelog entry is missing instead of blocking the release flow.

## [0.1.11] - 2026-04-17

### Changed

- Moved Git panel auto-refresh ownership fully into the Git store so the app layer now only controls panel lifecycle while repository watching and refresh coalescing stay inside the Git driver path.
- Updated the Git panel view to observe the Git store directly, keeping automatic file-status refreshes and remote sync state changes in the same render chain.

### Fixed

- Fixed Git file list auto-refresh so local file creates, deletes, and AI-generated changes now update the panel immediately while it is open, without requiring a manual refresh.
- Fixed Git panel refresh behavior to preserve the selected file and visible diff state across automatic repository refreshes instead of dropping back to stale or empty detail state.
- Fixed terminal focus restoration after project switches, window reactivation, and unminimizing so the shell can accept input again without an extra click.
- Fixed Git file row trailing actions so hover controls no longer change row height and the right-side status/action slot stays layout-stable.

## [0.1.10] - 2026-04-17

### Changed

- Split AI runtime probing into tool-specific services so Codex, Claude, Gemini, and OpenCode now own their own realtime probing and metadata lookup paths instead of keeping that logic in one shared probe file.
- Kept the runtime ingress and driver layers focused on routing only, with hook parsing, transcript probing, and external-session matching moved closer to each tool implementation.

### Fixed

- Fixed realtime loading/completion state recovery for Codex and Claude so prompt submit, interrupt, stop, and completed turns no longer bounce between stale `responding` and `idle` states.
- Fixed stale response payloads from reviving older realtime sessions after a newer snapshot had already moved the session back to idle.
- Fixed Claude hook session mapping so hook payload session IDs are captured more reliably, including stop-failure and resumed-session paths.
- Fixed project and today token overlays so live session tokens continue to merge correctly into the current project summary while avoiding duplicate indexed totals.

## [0.1.9] - 2026-04-16

### Changed

- Prioritized hook-driven runtime state for Codex and Claude so live hook events now own the sidebar responding/loading state while file probing only supplements metadata.
- Simplified terminal interaction and renderer tuning so focus, command-arrow routing, cursor behavior, and GPU mode updates stay closer to native terminal behavior without the extra temporary boost path.
- Reduced debug-log noise by de-duplicating repeated `startup-ui` and `activity-phase` lines during rapid window activation and workspace rebuilds.

### Fixed

- Fixed stale loading state after interrupt, app switching, or delayed probe refreshes by persisting interrupt timestamps and blocking older runtime snapshots from reviving `responding`.
- Fixed Claude and generic wrapper runtime completion reporting so wrapped tool exits emit a final completed state instead of leaving lingering running metadata behind.
- Fixed terminal focus/selection edge cases so split switching no longer re-triggers unnecessary stats refreshes and `Cmd+Left/Right` navigation works reliably with normalized modifier handling.

## [0.1.8] - 2026-04-16

### Added

- Added a three-part titlebar performance monitor that separates CPU, memory, and graphics usage so terminal rendering overhead is easier to read at a glance.
- Added terminal GPU mode controls in Settings with localized labels for high-performance, balanced, and memory-saver rendering profiles.

### Changed

- Rebalanced terminal rendering so the default balanced mode keeps the smoother low-jank GPU path while the memory-saver mode can trade idle graphics usage for lower footprint.

### Fixed

- Fixed terminal renderer churn by carrying pane focus, visibility, and reduced-memory hints through the workspace layout instead of treating every pane as fully active.
- Fixed memory-saver mode so a single focused terminal can temporarily promote back to Metal during interaction or live output, then fall back after idle without destabilizing the default experience.
- Fixed the performance monitor memory reading to split graphics footprint from general process memory, avoiding misleading single-number totals in the titlebar.

## [0.1.7] - 2026-04-16

### Changed

- Local packaging now always produces a verbose debug build by default, while the GitHub release workflow calls the release packager directly for formal release artifacts.
- Defaulted the manual test-build workflow and helper script to Debug so ad hoc verification runs keep the richer diagnostics profile unless explicitly overridden.

### Fixed

- Restored the macOS Settings toolbar tabs after the standard window chrome pass so the preferences header no longer disappears.
- Let the Settings window height follow the selected section instead of staying stuck at a single fixed height.

## [0.1.6] - 2026-04-16

### Added

- Added a dedicated Open Project action on the welcome screen so existing folders can be opened without going through project creation flow.
- Added configurable terminal GPU acceleration and performance-monitor settings in Preferences, including localized labels and adjustable sampling intervals.
- Added a helper release script plus release packaging updates so published builds include the signed zip, dmg, debug dmg, and SHA256 checksums together.

### Changed

- Refined the AI today-level presentation, welcome-screen buttons, and split-pane inactive overlay styling for more consistent macOS 14/15 appearance.
- Defaulted the Dock badge preference to enabled for new installs and for older snapshots that do not yet carry that setting.
- Split app logging into release-friendly compact mode and verbose debug packaging mode for easier user diagnostics.

### Fixed

- Fixed startup recovery and project-open fallback flow so failed terminal restoration no longer blocks entering the project shell.
- Fixed repeated terminal host/environment rebuild churn and improved diagnostics around terminal startup on macOS 14.
- Fixed the VS Code open action crash by avoiding main-actor state updates from LaunchServices completion callbacks.
- Fixed the Settings window standard-titlebar restoration on macOS 14.5 so the traffic-light controls no longer render offset into the content area.
- Fixed performance-monitor logging/session rollover behavior so each launch starts with a fresh rotating log set.

## [0.1.5] - 2026-04-16

### Changed

- Reduced real-time activity refresh pressure by coalescing runtime bridge and project activity updates instead of recomputing on every pulse.
- Smoothed Git file row hover actions so the action slot stays layout-stable and avoids needless view churn while moving the pointer.

### Fixed

- Fixed Claude session-end handling so stopping a run clears the responding state correctly instead of leaving the sidebar activity indicator spinning.
- Stopped the AI stats terminal-output path from repeatedly re-importing runtime state on every chunk of terminal output, reducing unnecessary CPU work during high-frequency responses.

## [0.1.4] - 2026-04-16

### Added

- Added in-app diagnostics export so users can collect logs and troubleshooting data from the Help menu more easily.
- Added a dedicated `test-build.sh` entrypoint and manual GitHub Actions test-build workflow for non-release verification builds.

### Changed

- Improved the README and Chinese README with clearer diagnostics and issue-reporting guidance.
- Updated the release/test packaging flow so test artifact labels are separated from the app's internal version number.

### Fixed

- Hardened project/settings persistence recovery so invalid saved data is less likely to block launch or project creation.
- Restored AI runtime hook setup more safely, including rebuilding user hook configuration when needed without clobbering unrelated content.
- Stopped workflow artifacts from distributing raw `.app` bundles, reducing broken-download cases caused by damaged app bundles after artifact transfer.

## [0.1.3] - 2026-04-16

### Changed

- Refined the terminal and right-side assistant chrome so the top and split dividers use a unified separator treatment.
- Softened the AI Assistant card backgrounds and increased the panel title spacing for a calmer visual rhythm.

### Fixed

- Corrected the terminal top-left border rendering so only the intended top and left edges are drawn, without broken joins or stray rounded corners.
- Fixed the right sidebar top divider gap when opening the panel.
- Removed the Git commit split menu checkmark state so action items no longer look like persistent selections.

## [0.1.2] - 2026-04-16

### Changed

- Refined the main app chrome so the selected sidebar project and top-right titlebar controls read more clearly with stronger, more consistent background emphasis.
- Increased the About window action button sizing for better visibility and click comfort.
- Rebalanced the daily work-intensity ladder to `5M / 10M / 30M / 70M / 100M / 200M / 300M`.
- Renamed the daily intensity tiers to short, shareable work-state labels.

### Fixed

- Adjusted the Git commit split dropdown width so the action layout is centered and visually stable.
- Localized the daily intensity tier names across all bundled languages instead of mixing the new Chinese labels with legacy rank names.

## [0.1.1] - 2026-04-15

### Changed

- Refreshed the product screenshot used in the repository and release materials.
- Polished the Git panel interaction details and visual states.

### Fixed

- Hid the branch/header toolbar when the current directory is not a Git repository.
- Fixed the commit split button layout so the primary action and dropdown no longer render with mismatched widths or background fills.
- Tuned the split button divider visibility so it remains visible without looking too heavy.
- Improved Git file/history hover action readability by using self-contained button backgrounds that no longer let underlying text show through.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-04-15

### Added

- First public Codux release.
- Native macOS terminal workspace for AI coding tools with project workspaces, split terminals, integrated Git panel, AI usage tracking, localization, update checks, and universal macOS release packaging.
